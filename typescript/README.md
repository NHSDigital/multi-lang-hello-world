# Apprentices end-of-year assessment (September 2020)

This sample TypeScript project is provided to help you have a suitable environment ready to use during your assessment.

To set this hello world project up, on a terminal navigate to the projects folder and run:

`npm install`

Tests should be runnable by running:

`npm run test`

This project is just the bare bones that is required for the assessment, not necessarily best practice. Please follow what you have learnt over the past year.

All code that you should be editing is in the `src` folder. The other files are used for setting up the TypeScript environment
