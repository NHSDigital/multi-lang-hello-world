# Apprentices end-of-year assessment (September 2020)

This sample C# class is provided to help you ensure that you have a suitable environment ready to use during your assessment.

The code is just the bare bones that are required to ensure that you can run unit tests. Code style should not be taken as an indicator of best practice. Please follow the coding standards that you have learnt over the past year.

All the classes have been written in one `.cs` file. Although this is not normal practice, you can follow this during your assessment if you want, or you are free to put the code in separate `.cs` files if you prefer.

To use this class:
* Create a console application
* Replace the default `Program.cs` with the `Program.cs` from this repository (adjust the namespace, if necessary, to be the same as your solution name)
* Add the NUnit NuGet package to the solution using `Manage Packages for Solution`
* Ensure that you can run `Test1`.

If anything in these instructions is not clear, please contact me before the assessment day.
