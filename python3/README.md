# Apprentices end-of-year assessment (September 2020)

This sample python project is provided to help you have a suitable environment ready to use during your assessment.

To set this hello world project up, on a terminal navigate to the projects folder and run:

`pipenv install --dev`

Tests should be runnable by running:

`pipenv run nose2`

This project is just the bare bones that is required for the assessment, not necessarily best practice. Please follow what you have learnt over the past year.
